Started with the IOOS environment.
pip install XROMS and $ pip3 install --upgrade roguewave

If doing it again, should add pip to environment.

Installed wavespectra...that worked, but now using new code, so have to run it locally.  
It seems to need netcdf4<1.6.0, so downgraded many pkgs with `mamba "install netcdf4<1.6.0"
