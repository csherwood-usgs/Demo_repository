Github was launched in 2008, and bought by Microsoft in 2018  
GitLab was launched as open source in 2011 by two Ukranians  

83% of StackOverFlow poll respondants use GitHub  
37% use GitLab  

Github offers more, including 374 free apps in its marketplace  
GitLab is  a more complete, internally integrated platform, but supports integration with external packages including Asana, Jira, MS Teams, Slack, Gmail, and others

Github recomended workflow focusses on one-stage review and thus more rapid deployment of the main branch    
GitLab recommended workflow involves several layers of review  

The markdown synataxes ( GFM and GLFM ) are slightly different.
