### My Git workflow
* Make a repo on GitHub with a README.md
* Clone the repo to my local computer `git clone URL`
* Copy in my license, disclaimer, do `git add *.md`
* Make my first notebook, do some work
* Save the .ipynb file and add it to git to be tracked `git add 'my_new_notebook.ipyng'`
* Stage and commit the changes in one command `git -a -m "notes on the new changes"`
* Commit with `commit`
* Push the changes to the repo `git push`
* Next time I work on it from somewhere, start with `git pull`
